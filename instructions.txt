
Take the new intervention data and find it’s mean (we’ll call it new sample mean).
Plot the new sample mean on the graph and check in which deviation it lies.
If the new mean is greater than the sampling mean then the intervention is successful.
Find the z score using the formula ( new sample mean - sampling mean) / standard deviation.
